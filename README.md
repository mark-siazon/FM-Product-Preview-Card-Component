## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

- Mostly review about: 
  - Responsive layouts
  - Bootstrap
- Utilize more of the bootstrap classes than the past.
- Create a documentation like this one, which is my first .md to seriously create.

### Continued development

- Planning to learn more about CSS Layouts (Grid and Flexbox)
- More responsive and accurate styling (margins, paddings, etc.) 
- Looking forward to use CSS Tricks and more pseudo tricks in the future.
- More efficient approach in creating front-end designs, and much more.
- And lastly, implementation of Javascript in web development journey.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - I'll admit that i used this website a lot, searching for fixes while I progress.
- [W3schools](www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3docs](www.w3docs.com) - This helped me for learning more about Pseudo CSS and other deeper CSS tricks.
- [Coderjony](https://coderjony.com/blogs/media-queries-in-css-min-width-and-max-width) - A great article that helped me recall using media queries, specially min/max-width.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank first in myself to do these things instead of just sleeping. Also to the internet and the websites I specified in the "Useful resources" section, or some that isn't, which is probably I forgot. Also to the FrontEndMentor for providing these resources for everyone to learn much easier, and not just get stuck in tutorial hell watching random videos.
